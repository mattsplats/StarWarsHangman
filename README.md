# Week11-Hangman
UT Coding Bootcamp Week 11 Homework

I received an Amazon Echo as a gift, and rather than do a console-output Hangman game, I decided to develop an Alexa Skill that plays hangman via voice commands. The code is hosted on AWS Lambda and executes every time an "invocation" command is made to an Alexa device.

This does make it a bit tricky to grade. Eventually I may publish it (with a different word list - doubt I could get away with using Star Wars), but until then it would have to be a) loaded onto your own AWS account, which is non-trivial, or b) tested while logged into my Amazon account.  Echosim.io provides a web interface for Alexa, so when you go to test it I could login for you, or possibly create a dummy account with the Alexa skill loaded so you could login and test.

Just let me know and we'll figure something out.  Or I could just bring the Echo into class ...
