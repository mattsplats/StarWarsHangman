# Star Wars Hangman
> *"First word: blank E blank blank"*

I received an Amazon Echo as a gift, and rather than do a console-output Hangman game, I decided to develop an Alexa Skill that plays hangman via voice commands. The code is hosted on AWS Lambda and executes every time an "invocation" command is made to an Alexa device.

No attempt was made to publish this Alexa skill, for obvious reasons ;-)
